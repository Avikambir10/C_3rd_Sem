//Program to reverse a string using stack...

This is a C program to reverse a string using a stack. 

A stack is a data structure that follows the last in, first out (LIFO) principle. In this program, a stack is used to reverse a string. 
The string is first pushed onto the stack, and then popped off in reverse order. This results in the string being reversed.

The program first includes the necessary header files. Then, it defines a stack of characters, an output array of characters, and a top variable to keep track of the top of the stack.
The push() function pushes a character onto the stack, and the pop() function pops a character off the stack.

The main() function first gets a string from the user. Then, it pushes each character of the string onto the stack.
Next, it pops each character off the stack and stores it in the output array. Finally, it prints the reversed string.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The program includes the necessary header files.
2. It defines a stack of characters, an output array of characters, and a top variable to keep track of the top of the stack.
3. The push() function pushes a character onto the stack.
4. The pop() function pops a character off the stack.
5. The main() function first gets a string from the user.
6. Then, it pushes each character of the string onto the stack.
7. Next, it pops each character off the stack and stores it in the output array.
8. Finally, it prints the reversed string.
